## Released by Sys#0002 (Chris)

**Yo, In this self-biographical text, I will share my experience learning Lua and offer some tips for those who are struggling to learn it...**

* Notice: Before I start, I want to mention that most of the information in this text comes from my past knowledge and experiences. If you are having difficulty learning programming, I hope that this text will be helpful for you. <3 *

### 1 - Finding The Right Type of Learning.

Hi, welcome to this introduction to this self-biography text on how I learned lua, and how you can get started. The whole reason I wrote this is because, you and I know 12yo\s has problems with learning.

[Lua 5.1 docs](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#1.0)

For starters, I would recommend reading the docs - But if you're some kid with low brain capacity to understand this type of reading, I suggest you visit some Roblox Lua Youtubers. For e.g

### 2 - Asking People With More Knowledge
If you don't have friends who know how to code, don't be afraid to reach out to others for help. You can try joining online communities or forums specifically for programming, or even just asking someone you know who has more experience than you. When asking for help, it's important to be honest about what you know and don't know. This way, the person you are asking will be able to better gauge their level of explanation and give you appropriate resources.

### 3 - Using Other Programming Languages as leverage

Learning multiple programming languages can be helpful because many of them have similar concepts and structures. For example, many programming languages use similar data types and control structures. By learning one language, you can often get a better understanding of how other languages work. If you find lua difficult to learn, you might want to try starting with a simpler programming language, such as Scratch or Python, which are specifically designed for beginners.

### 4 - Putting Your Learnings To The Test

While reading and watching tutorials can be helpful, it's important to also practice coding on your own. This will help you get a feel for how the language works and give you a chance to apply your knowledge. When you encounter a problem or error, try to debug it on your own before asking for help. This will help you develop your problem-solving skills and deepen your understanding of the language.

### 5 - Experience More than just Reading Simple Code

It's easy to read through code and think you understand it, but it's important to also try running the code and experimenting with it to truly understand how it works. When you play around with the code, you may discover new things about how it functions and get a deeper understanding of the language. Remember, just reading code isn't the same as understanding it â€“ take the time to really dig into the code and figure out how it works.

### **Have A Nice Time Learning!**
